This readme file contains a breif description of how the Task Management works.
Although there currently isn't a link to the hosted version due to some challenges while trying to deploy on render.

To run the application,

on windows 
py manage.py runserver 

on linux subsystems
python3 manage.py runserver

putting the default link provided after executing above command redirects to the signup page and everything goes from there.

Every other page can be navigated to by creating an account and logging in.
